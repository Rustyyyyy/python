Data structures are containers that organize and group data types together in different ways. A list is one of the most common and basic data structures in Python.

You saw here that you can create a list with square brackets. Lists can contain any mix and match of the data types you have seen so far.


You saw that we can pull more than one value from a list at a time by using slicing. When using slicing, it is important to remember that the lower index is inclusive and the upper index is exclusive.
